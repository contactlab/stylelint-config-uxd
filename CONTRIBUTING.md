## üöß Branching
We follow a [Gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

![Feature Branches](http://puu.sh/lP4eT/43f3131730.png)

We try to keep two main branches at all times:

- `master` for production
- `develop` for current development, a branch off `master`

#### Branch Prefixes
When branching, try to prefix your branch with one of the following:

Prefix     | Description                                                               | Example
-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------
`feature/` | New feature was added                                                     | `feature/add-learning-outcome-alignment`
`fix/`     | A bug was fixed                                                           | `fix/crash-when-code-submission-finished`

## üí¨ Commit Message Format
Each commit message should include a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <subject>
```

Lines should not exceed 100 characters. This allows the message to be easier to read on github as well as in various git tools and produces a nice, neat commit log ie:

```
#271 feat(src/rules.js): add 'color-no-invalid-hex' rule
#270 fix(src/index.js): add semicolons after every statement
#269 chore(readme.md): update 'usage' paragraph
```

#### Type
Must be one of the following:

Prefix     | Description
-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`feat`     | A new feature
`fix`      | A bug fix
`chore`    | Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

#### Scope
The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example editorconfig, readme, package, etc...

#### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* Don't capitalize first letter
* No dot (.) at the end
